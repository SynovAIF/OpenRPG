# OpenRPG Update for Gloomrot

> Since the release of Gloomrot by Stunlock Studios for V Rising, the original RPG mod could no longer
> be used as many lines of code needed to be updated. Now, it is possible again to use the OpenRPG mod
> with all its features!

# By the community for the community

> It was particularly important to us that the code is open source to guarantee great support and to offer
> other mod developers the opportunity to develop plugins for the OpenRPG at any time. This project is free
> and for everyone, it's from the community for the community and everyone is part of the development!

# The Future of OpenRPG

> We will soon share our future plans for OpenRPG with you. Initially, a stable public version is our focus!
> There is a good chance that in the future the OpenRPG mod will get a UI to have a clean and easy to use mod!
